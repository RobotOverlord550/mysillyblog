        <h1>Welcome to My Silly Little Blog</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            This is a little blog I'm making to get my ideas out to the world for anyone who wants to listen.
            It's very free form and experimental.
            I thought about using a premade blog static site generator; however, I wanted to have more fine tune control available if I wish.
            That's why this site is written in mostly pure HTML/CSS.
            Anyway, as I develop this site I will make seperate sections but for now its one page due to their only being one post.

        <div class="post">

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                I've been thinking a lot about my place in the world. What to I want to do with my life? Will my choice be sufficient to
                my acquisition of independence? I've been combing for the answer to these questions for years and the lack of a concrete
                path forward has had a huge toll on my mental health. It seems every day I question what I was put on this world for, if
                anything at all.
            </p>
            <p><b>I see others around me</b>:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Making goals</li>
                <li>Sticking with those goals</li>
                <li>Not getting distracted by other goals</li>
                <li>Ultimately, achieving their goals</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                With the way my brain works, at this moment in time, I am unable to move beyond step 1. I make plenty of goals and I
                have plenty of aspirations. Actually completing these goals is another matter. I've been unsure of the barriers that
                keep me from sticking with my goals and I want to use this blog post as a "journal" of sorts to track my current
                understanding of how I want to move forward with this dilemma. It will also act as an introduction to my suspected
                autistic features and a brief backstory on my history considering this is a brand new blog. In fact, I'm writing this
                post before even programming this site due to a sudden flow of ideas.
            </p>
            <h4>My Background in Context</h4>
            <p>Some boring stuff real quick, before I get into the meat and potatoes.</p>
            <p>
                Since being a small child (around kindergarten), I've been innately aware of my "oddness." Particularly due to the new
                social environment of primary school and the social implications that come with it. I was an only child for the first 10
                years of my life. I did not have much social interaction with other children around my age. The only exception being my
                cousin whom I saw often, but did not give me a clear understanding of how other young children behave due to his own
                "oddness." Being outcasted by my peers very early on made it very easy for my child mind to understand how divergent I
                was from others. The main takeaway I got from these early interactions was that I am "weird."
            </p>
            <p>
                Later on in my school social life I started actually making friends, primarily due to being accepted to a small magnet
                program at another nearby elementary school. The reason this shift helped me make friends was simply a more accepting
                culture of students. At least more accepting of neurodivergency. I suspect this increased acceptance may have come from
                the average income of a family at my new school being less than my previous school. Who knows? maybe learning to survive
                with limited resources trains people to make friends with people they normally wouldn't. In any case, I got to see and
                examine my own behavior more clearly due to simply having more interactions. I became more aware of my own hyperactivity
                and so did my parents. Beyond that I didn't realize much more, at least at the time; however, the information gathered
                in this time in my life proved invaluable to my current understanding of who I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking beyond primary school, I found my dad (an A+ person BTW) to be extremely supportive, but extremely "pushy." He
                was consistent in giving excellent advice and being a great dad, but he always expected me to be extremely gifted in
                intelligence and thought that I could achieve whatever I dreamed. He pushed this narrative onto me. I loved being
                praised so much, but I do not think it was helpful in the long run.
            </p>
            <h4>The False Narrative I Force Onto Myself</h4>
            <p>Alrighty, now so actual insights.</p>
            <p>
                I think the narrative seed my dad planted has lead to me having unrealistic expectations on where I should be in life
                right now. Most of these expectation where contrived from what my dad told me as a child, but are ultimately created by
                me and my hubris. The remaining expectations where likely contrived by my excellent performance in school.
            </p>
            <p>
                I seem to have a strong desire to supersede everyone around me. I want to rise to the top because I know I'm capable of
                it. Why not, if I can get an A in college calculus, I can surely be president, or work at NASA. I never even had these
                unreasonable ambitions for malicious intent. I always dreamed of how I could use my position to make society more
                enjoyable to be part of. I still consider it my interesting flavor of narcissism. I still hold these beliefs. Not
                consciously, but subconsciously. I know this due to anything being presented to me that's contrary to these beliefs
                causing an immense amount of anxiety. Consciously, I seem to have shifted to having no purpose and not having any
                confidence. Hell, that's why I'm writing this post. The tug of war between complete helplessness and immense amounts of
                confidence is absolutely exhausting.

            <h4>The Consequences of the False Narrative</h4>
            <p>I'm bored so I'm gonna make a bulleted list for this one</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insomnia
                    <ul>
                        <li>Up at night windering why I can't...
                            <ul>
                                <li>finish school</li>
                                <li>
                                    stay out of the mental hospital (don't worry, I'm not a lunatic, actually no one is but that's a different topic)
                                </li>
                                <li>get a job</li>
                                <li>be independent</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>anxiety attacks</li>
                <li>manic episodes</li>
                <li>dissociation</li>
                <li>severe depression</li>
                <li>and of course
                    <ul>
                        <li>why the fuck I'm alive in the first place</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How I Plan to Move Forward</h4>
            <p>back to paragraphs...let's go!</p>
            <p>
                I'm going to be patient with myself, which is very challenging for me. This plan that I'm about to propose to myself and
                anyone else reading this is very loose and interchangeable.
            </p>
            <p>Just kidding back to lists</p>
            <table>

                    <td>
                        I want to stop trying to rationalize why I do things purely based on my desire. I want to embrace the empathetic side of
                        my I've neglected and try to show the people I love that I can respect the person they love (me). If I hurt myself I'm
                        hurting my Fiance's Lover, my parents child, my siblings' sibling, my friends...uh...friends, etc. That holds much more
                        weight to me than my own suffering.

                        I'm very used to not existing, I didn't exist for 13 billion years. The fact that I am a conscious being with any
                        experience is beyond my understanding as Emma. The observer (the thing watching Emma writing this post) might be able to
                        understand more, but in a different way. Emma is no more than a thinking machine just like a computer only made with
                        flesh rather than transistors. Maybe I should acknowledge that the observer doesn't really have any goals, just like an
                        audience member of a stage-play doesn't have any goals or ambitions for the main character.

                        I have awesome parents that give me and my fiance independent housing, away from both our familys, I have a kick ass
                        laptop to write this post and to program this blog that my parents got for me, and I have food on the table. Oh and also
                        I generally have plenty of engaging activities.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Understand I'm only fucking 21</td>
                    <td>That's pretty self explanatory. I just have a lot to grow as a young adult.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h4>Finally</h4>
            <p>
                Please take all this with a grain of salt. It is just my thoughts that I used my thinking machine to make. I want you to
                use your thinking machine before making any rash decisions on ways to integrate any of this into your life. I may make a
                more in depth, research based, post which will most likely be more reliable as a source of inspiration or whatever.
                Lastly, this post was not tied together very neatly so sorry about that.
