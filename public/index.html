            A little blog I'm making to get my ideas out to the world for anyone who wants to listen.
            It's very free form and experimental.
            I thought about using a premade blog static site generator; however, I wanted to have more fine tune control available if I wish.
            That's why this site is written in mostly pure HTML/CSS.
            Anyway, as I develop this site I will make seperate sections but for now its one page due to their only being one post.
