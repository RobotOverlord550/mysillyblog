        Quick Posts is a section where I posts quick articles that I through together quickly. Think of it as my public
        journal. I get a lot of ideas flowing through my head on a daily basis which doesn't mix well with my ADHD. To
        allow me to rember these thoughts I'm going to write them here while they're still fresh on my mind, so I can
        look
        back on them for help. I'm making them public because I hope that some of my ideas may be helpful to some,
        regardless of if I make a higher quality article.
