                Quick Posts is a section where I posts quick articles that I through together quickly.  Think of it as my public journal.  I get a lot of ideas flowing through my head on a daily basis which doesn't mix well with my ADHD.  To allow me to rember these thoughts I'm going to write them here while they're still fresh on my mind, so I can look back on them for help.  I'm making them public because I hope that some of my ideas may be helpful to some, regardless of if I make a higher quality article.
