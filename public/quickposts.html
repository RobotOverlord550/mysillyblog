          This is a section where I posts quick articles that I throw together in less than a day. Think of it as
          a public journal. I get a lot of ideas flowing through my head on a daily basis which doesn't mix well with my
          ADHD. To help me rember these thoughts, I'm going to write them here while they're still fresh on my mind, so
          I
          can look back on them for guidance. I hope that, by making them public, some of my ideas may be helpful. Be
          aware that these articles will likely vary in quality.
